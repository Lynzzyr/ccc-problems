Problem Description

In a sumac sequence, t1, t2, .., tm, each term is an integer greater than or equal 0. Also, each term,
starting with the third, is the difference of the preceding two terms (that is, tn+2 = tn - tn+1 for
n â‰¥ 1). The sequence terminates at tm if tm-1 < tm.

For example, if we have 120 and 71, then the sumac sequence generated is as follows:
120, 71, 49, 22, 27.

This is a sumac sequence of length 5.

Input Specification
The input will be two positive numbers t1 and t2, with 0 < t2 < t1 < 10000.

Output Specification
The output will be the length of the sumac sequence given by the starting numbers t1 and t2.

Sample Input
120
71

Output for Sample Input
5
